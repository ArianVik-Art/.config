- Make some convenient way to push, pull, get repos, etc.

  open recent projects:
    1. interface with nvim-mini.pick to pull up a list stored as a json file in nvim-data
    2. cd into correct location and open Oil when pressing enter

  clone: 
    1. cd into repo locaiton
    2. git clone [https link]

  pull:
    1.
    2.

  push:
    1. 
    2.


  diff against head revision:
    1. cd into repo root
    2. git show HEAD:[path/to/file (i.e. src/main.cpp)]
    3. diff against current buffer with vim's diff tool.
